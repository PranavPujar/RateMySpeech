To address this, we'll consider both brute-force and optimal solutions. In the brute-force approach, we would iterate through the array and for each element, check if there exists another element in the array that complements it to reach the target. This approach has a time complexity of O of n squared due to nested iterations. The space complexity remains Oh of one as no additional data structures are used. For the optimal solution, we can use a hash map (or dictionary) to store each element along with its index. While iterating through the array, we can check if the complement of the current element such as target minus current element exists in the hash map. This allows us to achieve a time complexity of Oh n and a space complexity of Oh of n due to the extra space used for the hash map. Some edge cases include an Empty Array When the input array is empty, there are no elements to form a pair, so the result is an empty list, a Single Element Array If the array contains only one element, it's impossible to find a pair that sums up to the target.
