In the first pass, we search for the leftmost occurrence of the target value using binary search. Once found, we record its index. Then, in the second pass, we search for the rightmost occurrence of the target value using binary search again. Upon discovery, we update the recorded index for the rightmost position of the target. This approach ensures that we achieve the desired result efficiently, with a time complexity of O(log n) for each pass, resulting in a total time complexity of O(log n). Additionally, the space complexity remains O(1) as we only utilize a few variables for tracking indices.

We continue this process recursively until we've traversed all connected land cells, forming one island. By marking visited cells, we avoid redundant exploration. We repeat this DFS process for each unvisited land cell, effectively counting all islands in the grid.
